# what is bash

BASH is an acronym for Bourne Again Shell, a punning name, which is a tribute to Bourne Shell (i.e., invented by Steven Bourne).

Bash is a shell program written by Brian Fox as an upgraded version of Bourne Shell program 'sh'. It is an open source GNU project. It was released in 1989 as one of the most popular shell distribution of GNU/Linux operating systems. It provides functional improvements over Bourne Shell for both programming and interactive uses. It includes command line editing, key bindings, command history with unlimited size, etc.

**In basic terms**, Bash is a command line interpreter that typically runs in a text window where user can interpret commands to carry out various actions. The combination of these commands as a series within a file is known as a Shell Script. Bash can read and execute the commands from a Shell Script
